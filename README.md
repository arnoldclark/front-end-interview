# Hello, we're excited to meet you!

Thanks for taking the time to apply for the role of Front-End Engineer at Arnold Clark! In this part of the interview process, we're looking to assess your technical skills so that we can see how you might fit into our organisation.

## Inclusivity

We want this to be an enjoyable and comfortable experience for you, and we want the interview process to be a partnership between us.

We are more than happy to make any reasonable adjustments to our process - please let us know at any time, before or during the interview, if there's something that would help.

Common requests include:

- Changes to text size, editor theme, colours and so on
- Asking us to repeat or rephrase questions
- Taking a comfort break to grab a drink or clear your head

We'll try to use clear and simple language as much as we can. We'll also try - as far as possible - to tell you in advance what we'll be discussing so that you feel prepared.

## The Task

For this part of the interview process, you have a choice of two technical tasks. We'll ask you to choose one at the start of the interview.

Please make sure that you read both sets of instructions so that you can make an informed decision, and you know what the task involves.

### Option 1: Mob Programming

Take part a mob programming session to show us how you like to work in a team.

[Instructions for the mob programming session.](MobProgramming.md)

### Option 2: Show and Tell

Walk us through a project you've been involved in that will demonstrate your technical ability.

[Instructions for show and tell.](ShowAndTell.md)

## Assessment Criteria

We're aiming to make a fair and objective assessment of your skills, and to make sure they match the skills we need at Arnold Clark.

We also want to be transparent about the skills and traits we're looking for.
