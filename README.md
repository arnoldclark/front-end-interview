# Hello, we're excited to meet you!

Thanks for taking the time to apply for Arnold Clark. In this part of the interview process, we're looking to assess your technical skills so that we can see how you might fit into our organisation.

## Inclusivity

We want this to be an enjoyable and comfortable experience for you, and we want the interview process to be a partnership between us.

We are more than happy to make any reasonable adjustments to our process - please let us know at any time, before or during the interview, if there's something that would help.

Common requests include:

- Changes to text size, editor theme, colours and so on
- Asking us to repeat or rephrase questions
- Taking a comfort break to grab a drink or clear your head

We'll also try - as far as possible - to tell you in advance what we'll be discussing so that you can feel properly prepared.

## The task

For this part of the interview process, we have a choice of two technical tasks. Please make sure that you read both sets of instructions so that you know what the task involves.

### Option 1: Mob Programming

Take part a mob programming session to show us how you like to work in a team.

[Instructions for the mob programming session.](MobProgramming.md)

### Option 2: Show and Tell

Walk us through a project you've been involved in that will demonstrate your technical ability.
