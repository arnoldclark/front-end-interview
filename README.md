# Welcome to Hack Day 2022!

We're really excited to meet you!

This exercise is designed to give us a feel for how you would approach a fairly common problem here at Arnold Clark.

You'll be asked to work with some other participants, and with the help of a couple of mentors, hopefully you'll have a working solution at the end of the day!

_However:_ the process is more important than the outcome. While technical skills are important to us, it's more important that we hire people who communicate well and treat their colleagues with kindness and empathy.

Your mentors, and everyone working at the hack day, are here to guide you through the day and to help you have the best possible experience. If there's anything that would make you feel more comfortable, please don't hesitate to ask.

## The exercise

You have been asked to write a feature to allow users to view a list of cars, and add a new car to the list. Each car should have the following properties:

```
make: string
model: string
price: number
registration: string
```

The application uses the following technologies:

- On the back-end: Node.js, Express, MongoDB,
- On the front-end: React, hooks, styled-components

There is existing work that you can look at to help you with your approach. Your mentors will talk you through how to get the app running before you begin adding your own code.

Here is a list of things to discuss that might help you decide how to plan your approach:

- Consider where to start: front-end or back-end?
- Think about what data you will need to bring into your app
- Think about how you will display data in your app
- Think about how you will send data to the back-end
- How you will test any endpoints you write?

Your completed app might look a little bit like this:

Your mentors will be able to help you to use [Chassis](https://arnoldclark.github.io/chassis), our CSS framework.
