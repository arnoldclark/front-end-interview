## Technical ability

- The candidate put the user's experience at the forefront of their work.

- The candidate showed an interest in learning new or unfamiliar technologies.

- The candidate used the appropriate resources to overcome any technical issues they faced during the interview. (Google, MDN, Stack Overflow etc.)

### What type of code are we looking for?

"Good code" is highly subjective, and we would expect to see candidates with different levels of experience solve problems differently.

Having said that, here are some of the things we consider to be important when we're assessing a candidate's ability:

- Does the code show a solid understanding of the fundamentals of JavaScript and React?

- Are the application's components structured in a logical manner?

- Is there a separation between business logic and presentation?

- Is the code easy to test?

- Is the code properly formatted and easy to read?
