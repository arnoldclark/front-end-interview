# Option 2: Show and Tell

This session helps us to understand how you like to build front-end applications.

We'll ask you to take an app that you have recently built, and walk us through the codebase.

This might be an app that you have worked on professionally, an app that you built as part of an educational course, or a side-project that you have worked on in your spare time.

There are several other considerations:

- The app has to use React
- The app should be at least moderately complex

> Very important: make sure you have permission to share the code you'd like to demonstrate.

## About the session

When we start the interview, we'll ask you to run the application, and share your screen. We'll then ask you for a quick demo of the codebase.

We'll also ask you to share a link to the codebase so that we can go through it in some detail.

We'll discuss some of the following points, depending on your experience level:

- How did you decide what the user's needs were prior to building the app? How did you make sure you met their needs?
- How did you structure the app?
- How did you deploy the app?
- What problems would you anticipate in the codebase if you were to scale the app?
- What techniques, patterns and tools did you use to build your app?
- How did you test your app?
- What did you learn from building the app?
- What would you do differently if you were to do it again?

## What we're looking for

You don't need to show us a perfect app; if there are elements that don't quite work properly, or code that you would write differently, that's absolutely fine. Self-reflection and continuous learning are important to us.
